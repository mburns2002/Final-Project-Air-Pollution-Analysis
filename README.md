## Description of the Project 
For this project we will use data from Low Cost Sensors (LCS) in habitations in rural Tamil Nadu to investigate relationships between temperature, humidity and PM 2.5 levels in the region. 

## Data required and how it is obtained:
The data is from a low cost sensor (LCS) network deployed in Tamil Nadu, districts Kallakurichi and Nagapattinam.
AAM-LASSI dataset. Ambient Air Monitoring of LPG At Scale in South India. 
From Minaâ€™s research with the Center for Occupational and Environmental Health. 

## Three Tasks 
1. Look at connections between temperature and PM 2.5 in one district in India over a time period of about one year. 
2. Investigate relationship between humidity and PM 2.5 in one district in India over a time period of about one year. 
3. Compare the two districts, Kallakurichi and Nagapattinam (coastal and inland, respectively), for PM2.5 measurements. 

## Three additional skills
- Use of at least 5 `dplyr` verbs / functions (including summarize, group_by, count, filter, arrange, select, mutate) 
- Expansion of ggplot functions (to include more than default characteristics)
- Making layout and presentation into secondary output (e.g. .pdf) 

### Project files 

- `README.md` this file, a general overview of the repository in markdown format.  
- `.gitignore` Optional file, ignore common file types we don't want to accidentally commit to GitHub. Most projects should use this. 
- `<REPO-NAME>.Rproj` Optional, an R-Project file created by RStudio for it's own configuration.  Some people prefer to `.gitignore` this file.
- `priya-mina-final.Rmd`: where our work and outputs for this project are located.
