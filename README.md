## Final Project:  Analysis of Temperature and PM 2.5 levels in Tamil Nadu

## Team Members:

- Mina Burns @mburns2002
- Priya Riley @PriyaRiley

## Background 
The purpose of this exploration is to use data from Low Cost Sensors (LCS) in habitations within rural Tamil Nadu to investigate relationships between temperature, humidity, and PM 2.5 levels in the region. 

## Data Source 
Data from low cost sensor network deployed in Tamil Nadu, districts Kallakurichi and Nagapattinam.
AAM-LASSI dataset. Ambient Air Monitoring of LPG At Scale in South India.

## Research Questions 
1. Look at connections between temperature and PM 2.5 in one village in India over a time period of about one year. 
2. Investigate relationship between humidity and PM 2.5 in one village in India over a time period of about one year. 
3. Compare the two districts, Kallakurichi and Nagapattinam (coastal and inland, respectively), for PM2.5 measurements.
