### Mina working on question 3

![Tamil

![district map](district_map.jpg)

Notes: - flag represents data availability (da flag) - flagsum is
greater than 0 (qa flag). 

3)  Compare the two districts, Kallakurichi and Nagapattinam (inland and
    coastal, respectively), for PM2.5 measurements.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# loads in multiple packages at once and install packages
# if they are not installed locally
pacman::p_load(readxl, 
               base,
               data.table,
               DT,
               dplyr,
               ggplot2,
               graphics,
               readxl,
               tidyr,
               readr, 
               lubridate)
```

## read in data
```{r}
dailymeans <- read_csv("dailymeans_outdoor_HH_cleaned.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
dailymeans <- dailymeans[, -which(names(dailymeans) == "...1")]
head(dailymeans)
```

### Data Cleaning
Here, filter out data with qa and da flags (quality and data availability flags). 
```{r}
dailymeans <- dailymeans |> 
  filter(qa_flag == 0 & da_flag == 0) |> 
  select(-c(qa_flag, da_flag)) # drop these columns as no longer needed now 
```

### Analysis

Start analysis for question 3 Compare the two districts, Kallakurichi
and Nagapattinam (coastal and inland, respectively), for PM2.5
measurements.)

### Initial Visualization
Select PM2.5 as the variable of interest and visualize. 
```{r}
# filter for pm2.5 
dailymeans |> 
  filter(variable == "pm2.5") |> # filter for pm2.5 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x = date, mean_of_medians, color = district), alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_bw()
```

> Initial visualization shows up that there is a gap in the time that
> each district has data. Next, will subset to the dates that both
> districts are represented for.

```{r}
# what date is KK first represented? 
dailymeans |> filter(district == "KK") |> 
  arrange((date))
```

```{r}
# what does KK data go until? 
dailymeans |> filter(district == "KK") |> 
  arrange(desc(date))
```

```{r}
# change x axis 

# filter for dates that KK is represented in 
filtered_dates <- dailymeans |> 
  filter(date > "2022-08-04" & date < "2023-03-15") |> 
  filter(variable == "pm2.5")  # filter for pm2.5 
  
ggplot(data = filtered_dates) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = date, mean_of_medians, color = district), alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_bw()
```

> Nice, this is a better visualization. Let's improve the plot, add
> labels, and see what they look like on separate plots.

```{r}
filtered_dates |>
  ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x = date, mean_of_medians, color = district), alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Average PM2.5 over Time for Two Districts", x = "Date", y = "Average PM2.5") + 
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month" , date_labels = "%b-%y") + 
  theme_bw()
```

> Now we can see how the two districts compare. Let's visualize them with a facet wrap next. 

```{r}
filtered_dates |>
  ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x = date, mean_of_medians, color = district), alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Average PM2.5 over Time for Two Districts", x = "Date", y = "Average PM2.5") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 400, 50)) + 
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month" , date_labels = "%b-%y") + 
  facet_wrap(~district, ncol = 2) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```
Here, create a table with an average PM2.5 summary per district, along with standard error. 
```{r}
tab <- filtered_dates |>
  group_by(district) |>
  summarize(average = mean(mean_of_medians),
            se = sd(mean_of_medians) / sqrt(n()))
tab
```

Visualize the summarized values as a bar plot. 
```{r}
tab |> 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x = district, y = average, fill = district), color = "black") + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 50, 5)) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(title = "Average PM2.5 per District", x = "District", y = "Average PM2.5")
```
Facet wrap the two plots. 
```{r}
filtered_dates |>
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = date, mean_of_medians, color = district), alpha = 0.6) + 
  labs(title = "Average PM2.5 over Time for Two Districts", x = "Date", y = "Average PM2.5") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month" , date_labels = "%b-%y") + 
  facet_wrap(~district, ncol = 2) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

Generate a density plot for the averages of PM2.5. 
```{r}
filtered_dates |>
  ggplot() + 
  geom_density(aes(x = mean_of_medians, fill = district), alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Average PM2.5 Density", x = "Average PM2.5", y = "Density") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 400, 50)) + 
  theme_bw() 
```

### Analysis Results

> We see based on the results on the analysis that Kallakurichi (KK) has
> a higher average PM2.5, while Nagapattinam (NP) has lower average
> PM2.5. Referencing the map again, we can see that Kallakurichi is
> inland, and Nagapattinam is coastally located. Thus, one explanation
> for the differences between the PM2.5 for the two districts is the
> potential coastal influence of NP. The influx of wind from the sea can
> blow away particulate matter, reducing the average PM2.5 ratings
> picked up by the sensors. KK is quite far inland, so it wouldn't
> experience the same winds from the sea, which may explain why it has
> higher PM2.5 sensor readings.
